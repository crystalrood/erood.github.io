    "### No. Observations\n",
    "\n",

    "### Df Residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of degrees of freedom remaining. That is, the total degrees of freedom minus the model degrees of freedom).\n",

    "### Df Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of degrees of freedom used to train the model. In this case we trained our model to find four coefficients ($\\beta_{0}$+$\\beta_{1}$,$\\beta_{2}$, and $\\beta_{3}$) and thus used the number of coefficients minus one degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case `sales`) explained by the independent variables (`TV`,`Radio`, and `Newspaper`). R-squared is commonly used to judge how well the model fits the data. R-squared rages between 0 and 1 and is independent of the unit scale (in our model, dollars spent) of the data itself.\n",

    "R-squared is calculated:\n",

    "$$ R^{2} = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS} $$\n",

    "$$\\sum _{{i=1}}^{{n}}\\left(y_{{i}}-{\\bar  {y}}\\right)^{2}$$ \n",

    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-f(x_{i}))^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adj. R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with R-squared is that as you increase the number of predictors in a model, the variance explained by that model will increase, even if those predictors are not related to the response variable. This can become a problem if you are comparing the R-squared of the model with two predictors with the R-squared of a model with 200 predictors. In this case, the second model might have a greater R-squared simply because it contains more predictors. Adjusted R-squared compensates for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^{2}_{Adjusted} = 1 - \\frac{RSS/(n-d-1)}{TSS/(n-1)}$$\n",

    "where $n$ is the number of observations, and $d$ is the number of predictors (independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the number of predictors, $d$ is included in the calculation, adjusted R-squared statistic in penalized for each additional predictor. The idea is that each new predictor added has to be useful enough to the model that it is worth the penalty paid for its inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F-statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic tests whether all the coefficients are equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\beta_{1} =\\beta_{2}=\\cdots \\beta_{n}=0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F=\\frac{(TSS-RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-d-1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the number of predictors. The statistic works because based on the linear model assumptions we assume the expectation of the demoninator is also $\\sigma^{2}$ and if all the coefficients collectively equal zero, then the expectation of the numerator is $\\sigma^{2}$. In that case the F-statistic will be close to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why might look at the F-statistic first, instead of the individual coefficient p-values, is because if you have a large number of predictors unrelated to the response variable, just by chance some of them will be statistically significant. The F-statistic does not face this problem because $p$ in the denominator penalizes the statistic for each additional predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prob (F-statistic)\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value of the F-statistic. If it is not significant, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis:\n",

    "$$ H_{0}:\\beta_{1} =\\beta_{2}=\\cdots \\beta_{n}=0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### AIC\n",
    "\n",
    "Akaike information criterion (AIC) is another measure of the quality of the model, like R-squared. In general models with lower AIC are preferable to models with higher AIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AIC=\\frac{1}{n\\sigma^{2}}(RSS+2d\\sigma^{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $2d\\sigma^{2}$ is essentially a penalty placed upon the score to account for the fact that the errors in training models well tend to be naturally lower than errors in test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of observations and $d$ is the number of predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### BIC\n",
    "\n",
    "BIC is like AIC, taking a small value for a model with a low test error, the $2d\\sigma^{2}$ penalty term replaces the $2$ used in AIC with $log(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ BIC = \\frac{1}{n}(RSS+log(n)d\\sigma^{2}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $log(n)$ will be greater than 2 for models with more than seven observations, BIC has a greater penalty for models with many variables than AIC."
